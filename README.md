# helloRDMLA
This is being created to help me work through the tutorials in the Research Data Management Librarians' Academy,  Unit 7: Coding Tools
I am currently the director of a very small academic library.  While I have pretty solid skills in personal information literacy and research methods (especially as these are practiced within the liberal arts), I am pursuing the RDMLA in order to expand my skillset and increase my employment opportunities.
